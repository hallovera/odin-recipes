# odin-recipes

Basic recipe website created using HTML. It follows the instructions for the HTML project in the 
Odin Project's Foundations course.

Through completing this project, I gained experience in using and manipulating various HTML elements,
including paragraphs, links, lists (ordered and unordered), and images. I learned how to add,
edit, combine, and place these elements to create a good HTML website structure.

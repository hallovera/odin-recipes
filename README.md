# odin-recipes

Basic recipe website created using HTML. It follows the instructions given in the Odin Project HTML
assignment in the Foundations course.

By completing this project, I gained more experience using and manipulating various HTML elements,
including paragraphs, links, lists (ordered and unordered), and images. I learned how to add,
edit, combine, and place them to create a good HTML website structure.

      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          Kung Pao chicken, also transcribed Gong Bao or Kung Po, is a spicy, 
          stir-fried Chinese dish made with cubes of chicken, peanuts, vegetables 
          (traditionally Welsh onion only), and chili peppers. The classic dish in 
          Sichuan cuisine originated in the Sichuan Province of south-western China 
          and includes Sichuan peppercorns. Although the dish is found throughout 
          China, there are regional variations that are typically less spicy than the 
          Sichuan serving. Kung Pao chicken is also a staple of Westernized Chinese cuisine.

      <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          A chocolate brownie or simply a brownie is a square or rectangular chocolate baked confection. 
          Brownies come in a variety of forms and may be either fudgy or cakey, depending on their density. 
          Brownies often, but not always, have a glossy "skin" on their upper crust. They may also include 
          nuts, frosting, cream cheese, chocolate chips, or other ingredients. A variation made with brown 
          sugar and vanilla rather than chocolate in the batter is called a blond brownie or blondie. The 
          brownie was developed in the United States at the end of the 19th century and popularized there 
          during the first half of the 20th century.

          They are typically eaten by hand, often accompanied by milk, served warm with ice cream (a la mode), 
          topped with whipped cream, or sprinkled with powdered sugar and fudge. In North America, they are 
          common homemade treats and they are also popular in restaurants and coffeehouses.
